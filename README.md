## Problem Statement
Most datasets related to training robots for electronic tasks are proprietary and closed. The confidentiality of datasets limits growth in open-source robotic intelligence.

## Solution
We present an open-source dataset to train the SO-ARM100 robotic arm from Huggingface for circuit connection. 

### Features
- **Open Alligator Clips:** Arm picks up and opens alligator clips
- **Battery Placement:** Arm picks up and drops a AA battery into a power source.
- **Turn on LED:** Arm connects power to LED lightbulb to switch on

## Datasets
- **Alligator Clips:** [Arm picks up and opens alligator clips ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Techiiot/pick_allegator_battery)

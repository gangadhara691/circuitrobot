## Problem Statement
Most datasets related to training robots for electronic tasks are proprietary and closed. The confidentiality of datasets limits growth in open-source robotic intelligence.

## Solution
We present an open-source dataset to train the SO-ARM100 robotic arm from Huggingface for circuit connection. 

### Features
- **Open Alligator Clips** Arm picks up and opens alligator clips
- **Drop Battery** Arm picks up and drops a battery into a power source.
- **Turn on LED** Arm connects power to LED lightbulb to switch on
